practice on mapping and reducing

## Type of data
I like bmw cars because of their sporty look and comfort inside. I personally prefer to buy an used car rather than new car. So, I took data related to used bmw cars to know the price and year of the car accordeingly.
I took the data from kaagle. link to my data https://www.kaggle.com/mysarahmadbhat/bmw-used-car-listing

## Data problem
I would like to get the average price of each bmw model.

##  Data story
I have analyzed the data and sorted accoring to the sales of each bmw model. As per the data that shown after reducing bmw series 3 have the best reselling rate.
